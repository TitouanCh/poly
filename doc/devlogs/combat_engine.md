If you've played any amount of PC games, you're probably already familiar with the behemoth that are RTS games. From Starcraft to ... if you've spent any amount of time on the internet you've certainly stumbled upon footage of one of them.

A common problem for the genre is that these types of of game are hard to first start out in. And have a massive entry curve. This could explain why these types of game have fallen out of favor in the past decade being overshadowed by quote unquote simpler games: MOBAs and FPS.

This fact has inspired me to start this small, purely theoretical for now, project:
What would it take to make a simpler and easy to pickup game in the RTS genre.

I've built a small prototype of an RTS in the godot game engine, of
course I won't have the time to design a full game from the ground up in a single video, so this prototype is small in scope, still, let's try to tackle the most important issues that make RTS so hard to pickup and play.

I. APM, having no time to make many any decisions.
One big barrier to entry of RTS games is just how fast you need to play most effeciently, how you need to micro eve...

I've always been a big fan of massive battles in games, whether it be in RTS like Total War or turned-base strategy games.

Lately, I've been wondering what it would take for me to program a combat engine. What I mean by a combat engine is a programm that would allow me to simulate combat between massive army on my own machine.

Just like a physics engine allows you to compute how rigid bodies move and evolve over time.

A combat engine should be able to how two squads of knights would duke it out depending the

c) turning then moving
